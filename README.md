# Employee Salary Prediction with Linear Regression

Welcome to the Employee Salary Prediction project! In this repository, we demonstrate how linear regression can be applied to predict employee salaries based solely on years of experience.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict employee salaries using linear regression.
- **Dataset**: We use a simple dataset containing only the years of experience and corresponding salaries.
- **Methodology**: Linear regression modeling using scikit-learn.
- **Usage**: Explore the Jupyter Notebook file (`linear_reg.ipynb`) to understand the data, the model, and how to make predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `data.txt`: Contains the dataset in a plain text format.
- `linear_reg.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file with code for data analysis, model training, and predictions.
- `results/`: Stores model results, such as trained model files and prediction outputs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file (`linear_reg.ipynb`) to explore the project.

## Results

We achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of [insert your MSE value here] on our test data, indicating the accuracy of our salary predictions based solely on years of experience.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different regression algorithms.
- Incorporate additional features for more accurate predictions.
- Expand the dataset with more diverse samples.
